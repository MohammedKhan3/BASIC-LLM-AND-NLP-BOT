# AlgoBot - CODE -> MASTER BRANCH
AlgoBot is a Discord bot designed to provide structured, step-by-step explanations of various algorithms in JSON format. Built using Python, OpenAIâ€™s API, and spaCy for NLP, AlgoBot interprets algorithm-related questions and delivers detailed, easy-to-understand responses directly on Discord.

### Features
Algorithm Explanations: Provides explanations for algorithms like binary search, quick sort, merge sort, and more.

Structured Responses: Outputs explanations in JSON format, breaking down each algorithm into steps for clear understanding.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses spaCy to recognize algorithm keywords in user queries.

Customizable Responses: Randomizes prompts and utilizes temperature settings for more conversational, varied responses.

### Technologies Used
Python: Core bot logic and backend processing.
Discord API: For bot integration and message handling on Discord.
OpenAI API: LLM-powered explanations for algorithms.
spaCy (NLP): Identifies algorithm keywords from user queries.
